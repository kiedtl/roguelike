Lore speeches
- Curse you, @! Traitor! Mendicant!
  - You were sent here to help us destroy these cave goblins! Not to join them!
- [to prisoner] Blast you, miserable creature.
  - I can't wait until the day when we knock all your heads off.
  - Then I can spend my day on more productive tasks than having to keep an eye
    on you bastards.
- ...you? Again? Didn't we recapture you twice already?
  - Clearly, pain must be something you enjoy.
- You escaped? AGAIN?
- Obmirnul? Is that you?
  - Curse you, traitor. Your breath is a stain on the bones of your father.
  - Because of you, we are all disfavored in the eyes of our hill-goblins
    masters.
  - To them, we are all liable to become turncoats, as you did.
- [hunter to @] Looking for something?
- [hunter to @] Did you lose something here?
  - Maybe we can help you find it.
- [hunter to @] No no, please, don't worry.
  - We're not going to capture you again.
  - We'll just kill you this time.
  - Slowly.
- [death mage to @] So, you're the escaped prisoner I've been hearing so much about.
  - How have you eluded the guards for so long?
  - These idiot mercenaries and hill-goblins really need to get their act together.
- You bastard! YOU KILLED MY BROTHER ARBALD!
  - I'M GOING TO TURN YOU INTO A COLANDER! [bold/italic text]
  - (Wields a spear, and becomes invigorated + enraged)
  - (Must be higher levels, so maybe armored guard?)
- Treachery doesn't pay off, @.
  - The only reason these filthy cave-goblins like you is because they're more
    of the same.
  - They betrayed us and left us helpless in our greatest need.
  - Now look at them.
  - And look at you.
  - Pathetic.
- ...Obmirnul? Friend of the Earth Demons?
  - ...what? ...how?
  - ...
  - ...I can't even...
- [guard to companion] Did you hear about Magaren Dorazil?
  - Other: ?
  - He was mocking some of the caged Night Creatures in Lab/7.
  - Then, when he wasn't looking, some of them broke free and tore his head off.
  - We found it inside a nearby air-duct.
  - Other: What was he doing on Lab/7?!?
  - Looking for trouble I guess.
  - [both exit level]
- [Insurrection] Hey, look at this.
  - It's the body of... [checks poster] Magaren Dorazil.
  - Three days ago, my brother Nath said he saw a night creature here.
  - When we investigated, we found this body lying mangled in a heap.
  - I wonder what he did to invite the wrath of the Night.
  - I hear the invaders were trying to tear up some of sacred lairs in the
    lower Storage.
  - Perhaps he was one of them?

Rings
- Force all visible hostiles to prioritize another visible hostile (e.g.
  escaped prisoner)
  - Prisoner: "w..what? why are they all chasing me now?!"
  - Will-checked (or not?)
- Protection: creates protection sigils (terrain) on ground
  - Terrain is trampled into nothingness (or dead moss?)
  - Anything standing on it is protected for a single instance of damage, no
    matter how high
  - Need to think about mechanics, flavor, etc

- Sigil of Damnation
  - While undead/unclean is on it, angel is summoned (but will disappear if
    enemy steps off of it)
- Sigil of Hiding
  - Hide corpse, make it invisible until it's stepped on enough times (or enough
    time has passed).
- Sigil of Disarming
  - Anything that steps on it will be commanded to drop/throw their weapon. (They
    can then be assigned a job to re-equip it again later.)

- Opt
  - Packed coords
  - TinyAllocator

- Occasions for lore
  - Meeting player (when alert is low, so probably first occasion)
  - Meeting player (when alert is higher)
  - Player seeing guard who's near prisoner

- Italic/bold uxn font for certain lore
   - Goblin language?

- Visual filters
  - Water: blue filter
  - Bubbling water: green filter
  - Fire: red filter

- Hulkers reduce max HP as well as causing damage?

Capital: Elegdruinneyl (forest of green stars)

Hookah
- Guards may occasionally smoke this? (Only if it wouldn't give negative effect
  to player)
- Effects for player:
  - "Disgusting! It was full of cleaning solution!!" -- 1 acid damage (nonlethal)
  - "Ew! It was full of mold spores!" -- disorientation
  - "You inhale the fragrant smoke..." -- no effect
  - "You relax, and suddenly remember parts of the map from before your
    imprisonment." -- reveal staircase & area nearby
    - UI: should focus the stair under examine mode.

- Water
  - Restricts vision, along with slade
  - Allows seeing through shallow water though.
  - Causes random movement like in Brogue (implemented in .Water status)? Would be nice.

- Workshop
  - Needs to be harder? Still too easy to just pass through massive corridors
  - Chance for alchemist to "end shift" and leave the level. Another alchemist
    shows up and replaces them.
  - Coffeebreak rooms (see living dungeon in ~/doc/notes)
- Spectral items should somehow give MP
    - Visit lairs to instantly fill up on MP?

- Fix Sentry before calling for testers

Rework incineration/ignition potions
- Remove or comment out incineration (or make a very rare item)
- Add "bottle of fuel" and related gas.
  - Update fire mechanics.
- Fireplace that player can take advantage of, in the Prison and maybe
  Workshop. *Maybe* other levels, like Necropolis. Maybe.
  - In coffeebreak rooms

- Differentiate searching for player and remembers
  - Tooltip

- bug: attacking unaware enemy standing in locked door

- don't store state in prefab list, everything should be in fab_records
  - usage data
  - for serialization
- serialization optimizations
  - optimize fov
  - don't serialize path_cache... or maybe we must :(
    - idea: add "age" to each entry, if older than 100 turns can we get rid of it
      - the actual pathing code would have to ignore it also.
