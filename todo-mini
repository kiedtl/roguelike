- Visual filters
  - Water: blue filter
  - Bubbling water: green filter
  - Fire: red filter

- Change glyphs for prisoner/sparklings/stalkers around
- Bottle of fuel
- Stalker Re-theme to acid sprite?


- Water
  - Restricts vision, along with slade
  - Allows seeing through shallow water though.
  - Causes random movement like in Brogue (implemented in .Water status)? Would be nice.

- Grues should be more scary
  - Always emit insane gas?
  - Emit blinding gas as well?
- Hide lairs behind walls
  - 50% chance only for there to be a door
  - If aligned with NC, then you can see through the wall, and can pass through.
  - Otherwise, you have to get lucky with disintegration.
    - There will be hints, like in TGGW's "mysterious vein"
- Workshop
  - Needs to be harder? Still too easy to just pass through massive corridors
  - Chance for alchemist to "end shift" and leave the level. Another alchemist
    shows up and replaces them.
  - Coffeebreak rooms (see living dungeon in ~/doc/notes)
- Spectral items should somehow give MP
    - Visit lairs to instantly fill up on MP?
- Sigil of Hiding
  - Hide corpse, make it invisible until it's stepped on enough times (or enough
    time has passed).
- Sigil of Disarming
  - Anything that steps on it will be commanded to drop/throw their weapon. (They
    can then be assigned a job to re-equip it again later.)
- Flashing Z on mobs
- Fix Sentry before calling for testers

Rework incineration/ignition potions
- Remove or comment out incineration (or make a very rare item)
- Add "bottle of fuel" and related gas.
  - Update fire mechanics.
- Fireplace that player can take advantage of, in the Prison and maybe
  Workshop. *Maybe* other levels, like Necropolis. Maybe.
  - In coffeebreak rooms

- Differentiate searching for player and remembers
  - Tooltip

- bug: attacking unaware enemy standing in locked door

- don't store state in prefab list, everything should be in fab_records
  - usage data
  - for serialization
- serialization optimizations
  - optimize fov
  - don't serialize path_cache... or maybe we must :(

Done
