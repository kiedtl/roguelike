Oathbreaker is a coffeebreak roguelike focused on stealth. You are a prisoner in
a goblin outpost, and must escape before your impending execution.

Your health is extremely limited and doesn't regenerate until you find healing
items, and most of the enemies can bring you to a quarter of your health in just
a few fights. Even the weakest of enemies can easily draw half the floor onto
you when they turn to flee and call for help, so the few fights you do end up in
have to be ended quickly and with extreme prejudice.

The main mechanic in this game is modifying and manipulating your environment in
a prison-themed dungeon to distract, confuse, and kill your former jailers. You
can sneak in unlit areas, throw poisonous potions, raise corpses, stab paralyzed
enemies, release fellow prisoners, and do just about anything short of engaging
in what will be an almost-certainly fatal melee combat with enemies that are
simply far, far stronger than you are.

[Here's](https://tilde.team/~kiedtl/blog/roguelike) the (very outdated) initial
writeup back when I started the project in May 2021.
