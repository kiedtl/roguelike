- Vampirism (charm of transference)
x Buckler (+10% block)

  - Any undead adjacent to you take 2 dmg each turn.

Rings
-----
- ring of refrigeration
  - Must stand next to unaware living/undead (not constructed) monster
  - Theme:
    - Monster's mind is "frozen" for 20 turns.
    - They stand still in a confused state
  - Implementation:
    - They stand still, resting, doing nothing. No looking around, no moving.
    - ie special ai routine
  - Ends if they see an enemy or hear a noise.
  - Crucially, they refuse allies who try to push past them.
    - Thus the player can block a corridor or something with them.

- ring of revelation
  - Must stand next to unaware living/undead (not constructed) monster
  - Monster's mind is read
  - All squares (and adjacent squares) that a monster was in in the past 25
    (100?) turns is revealed
    - So if monster was patrolling, their patrol area is read
    - May be patchy? So each square has only 80% to be revealed, adjacent
      squares have 50% chance, squares adjacent to those have 5%, etc
  - Monster is left with a .Confused job, where they stand still and look
    around, as if they forgot what they were doing
    - No other impairments
  - Version for constructs?
    - Evocable: copper wand
    - Same mechanic, stand next to monster and read its memory
      - But it's not patchy, 100% chance to be revealed
    - Noisy, so it'll investigate you
      - Alternatively, it might require physical contact, so the construct is
       always aware of you

x ring of concentration: [holy] Increase willpower by a factor of 2, at the
  cost of melee%, evade%, and slowness.

x ring of condemnation: [holy] instakill undead, at cost of 10 turns held.
  Ancient Mage should have some kind of countermeasure (transform into
  something else? explode into swarm of enemies?)

! ring of fustigation: [holy] undead explode, causing other undead to explode,
  chain reaction
  - Explosion only over cardinals... unless disoriented, then it's only
    diagonals
  - will/2-will damage, damage stacks
  - cannot be used while corrupt and target must be undead, doesn't affect
    non-undead
  - Too "explicit", want more subtle magic...

! ring of abjuration: [holy] mark any living creature (even foe, even death
  mage) as "dispelling undead" causing any adjacent undead (even allies) to
  take damage
  - Too "explicit", want more subtle magic...

x ring of deceleration: Adjacent mobs have their attack speeds slowed
  significantly.

- ring of observation: Keep enemy in sight.
  - Utility
  - Useful for firewings
  - What else?

x ring of retaliation: +Spike and -10% Melee for each adjacent enemy.

x ring of protection: creates sigils of protection on ground
  - Confers "Shielded" that negates first damage that occurs, and nothing afterwards
  - Sigils disappear after one use

- ring of precognition: 0 MP, +15% evasion, MP drained selectively
  - option: 1 MP each time attacked
  - option: 1 MP every turn w/ enemies adjacent
  - option: MP every turn for every adjacent enemy

x ring of obscuration: Grants "invisible" status, drains 1 MP for each enemy
  that can see player in exchange for them not noticing player. No MP drain
  when player can't be seen. 0 MP to start with. (Needs downside. Maybe doesn't
  work if player is directly adjacent, or player is corrupted and target is
  undead?)

- ring of infestation: Gives infestation status (mob-only), "night beatles"
  burst out of affected mob when status effect ends. Night beatles should only
  be dangerous in larger numbers (maybe steal ghoul respawn mechanic from SPD?)
  - Potion of infestation + infestation gas: infestation status to
    paralyzed/will==0/in-dark-area mobs (still haven't decided, maybe a
    combination of the two

x ring of transformation: turns all fire into electricity. "Heals" the burning
  status, and targets self.

x ring of detonation: make enemy explosive+noisy+insane+immobile

x ring of insurrection: [anti-Holy] raise 3-7 nearby corpses to fight a
  specific mob, for 14-28 turns. Zombies are completely blind and won't fight any
  other monster unless attacked.

x ring of deception: [anti-Holy] undead mistake you for ally unless non-undead
  allies are nearby

- ring of conscription: [anti-Holy] raise the corpse the player stands on at
  the end of the pattern to fight, giving it impressive tankiness and stat
  boosts. Zombie will be immobile however, and will die if player moves more
  than 4 tiles away.

x ring of determination: [anti-Holy] regenerates significant amount of MP, and
  massive boost to willpower
  - Massive MP requirement
  - Significant drop in willpower afterwards (say, set to 0 or 1) for 20 turns.

x ring of exclusion: create line of special machine types that do will check
  against mobs which try to bump into them. If succeeds, mob can walk through.

- ring of suggestion: "suggest" a place to investigate to a mob that isn't
  aware of you
  - After one use, the mob acquires the "suspicious" status for 20 turns (or
    permanently?) and cannot be affected.
  - Alternatively, if you try to affect it again there's a 50% chance of it
    coming to investigate a coord near you instead.

- ring of execution: instantly kill a single living creature. Will-checked. If
  it succeeds, it "spreads" to adjacent living creatures, also will-checked.
  - Noisy (victims scream).

- ring of constriction: choke a living creature, preventing it from shouting.
  - Unbreathing mobs (angelic, night creatures, undead) should be immune.
  - Medium-high MP cost, and themed as a continuing action on part of the player.
  - Player gets to-hit debuff, target gets evasion/to-hit/martial debuff.
    - Target has 1/3 chance to spend a turn "gurgling"/"flails around in a panic"

- ring of excavation: break open the floor, sending a mob careening down
  - Task created for mob to reappear from staircase, wounded & w/ engineer
    - Engineers remove pit and check room, mob goes back to whatever it was doing
  - "Pit" is a new machine type.
    - Unwalkable.
    - "Why would you want to do that?" message when player tries to power it

- ring of deconstruction: rolling boulder

- ring of provocation: (Alvoc) Tear apart a nearby (standing on/adjacent)
  corpse in a crazed animal rage, causing all visible enemies to either flee or
  become enraged (50/50 chance). Target corpse must be "named".

x ring of magnetization: cause knockback of all nearby foes onto a single foe.
  Like Gell's Gravitas in DCSS. Knockbacked foes could possibly hit player, so
  player must plan accordingly.
  - Attack foe and move behind it.

x ring of electrification: Electrocute all mobs on one side.
  - Attack mob, move one tile backwards into corridor (ie with walls on the
    other two sides of your character), wait, attack forwards

x ring of teleportation: Zap an enemy, then teleport to where the zap ended
  (i.e. Blinkbolt spell).

x ring of damnation: create a fire explosion on all tiles containing foes.
  - Move towards a wall, wait, attack in the opposite direction.

x ring of electrocution: Electrocute tiles in four corners next to player.
  - Attack in a cardinal direction, move in opposite direction, move
    perpendicular, attack again

x ring of cremation: Makes all adjacent foes temporarily vulnerable to fire,
  and creates ring of flames in all adjacent squares.
  - Move all around mob in four turns (w/o attacking or resting).

x ring of extermination: fire bolt of fire in direction.
  - Move forward against guard, move right/left, move forward


Ideas:
- ring of ignition: Summon orbs of lava (a la DCSS' Foxfire).
  - Move in zig-zag direction away from mob.
- ring of ____________: (Alvoc) +50 attack speed, -50 move speed
- ring of distortion: (alt) Bends space around player, granting +20% evade and
  -20% melee.
- ring of ____________: Grants enemy on conductive terrain "gathering charge"
  status, causing them to take damage each turn they stand on that terrain
  (status is cured when they walk off)
- ring of demolition: Explosion centered on player, player takes no damage.
  (Needs some downside/quirk to make it interesting. Only works if completely
  surrounded (by either allies or enemies? hmm, could be useful for summoners)?
  Damage is low, but gives player bad/good effect for each enemy injured?)
- ring of ____________: Gives "sanctuary" + disorient status effects. Sanctuary
  status damages and .Held's(10) any mob adjacent (cardinals only), and doesn't
  affect mobs with .Held. Creates puzzle-like gameplay. Damage could scale with
  some stat.

Other ideas:
  - Passively allows player to know if they're still being pursued.
  - Allows player to see spots near pursuers (but not the pursuers
    themselves?) for ~3-5 turns.
    - Movement pattern:
  - Can destroy a wall tile, sending shards of lethally sharp stone
    hurtling towards adjacent mobs. Harder stones == more damage.
    .Deafening noise.
  - Vampirism idea: vampiric ring of draining
    - Drains an enemy for {speed,health,HP}.
    - Allows player to see that mob and all tiles within two spaces.
    - Player will get a status (paralyzed? slowed? negative regen? traumatize? stun?)
      for a bit when the enemy dies OR the enemy sees the player.
    - The drained mob immedietely becomes an enemy to everyone.
    - If the enemy dies, the player is teleported there in its place?
    - Movement pattern: ???
  - Causes dark gas to emanate from player. Gas is opaque and blocks all light.
  - Causes all nearby machines to lose power for a bit (aka turn out the lights).
  - Dismissal: forces all investigating mobs in LOS to return to working.
    If resisted by willpower, will reveal player's location to them.

Items/Machines
==============
x Add cloaks:
  x cloak of silicon (fire resistance)
  x cloak of fur     (electricty resistance)
  ~ cloak of velvet
    - 30% chance for hostile to not notice mob, even when mob is in hostile's FOV
    - Slightly increases dexterity
  x cloak of thorns
    - 40% chance for a missed melee attack to backfire on attacker, dealing
      moderate damage.
- Add evocables:
  x "eldritch lantern": dazes or blinds mobs in FOV; blinds player
    for 2 turns. 4 charges.
  x "symbol of torment"
  ~ "fume hood" (CAV): Grants rFume∞ for ~10 turns. 4 charges.
  ~ "hammer": Destroys a machine. ∞ charges; cannot be recharged.
  x "iron spike": Jams a door. 1 charge; cannot be recharged.

Fires/explosions
================
x Make monsters flee sooner if burning?
- Make steam a fire retardant?

Message pane

  x On seeing a mob cast a spell
  x On dodging by enemy or player
  x On death
  x On resisting a spell
  x On swapping weapon
  x On making a noise, or mob making a noise
x Messages that require confirm/keypress
x Only print trap messages when culprit is player
x Group identical messages in msgpane
x Attack messages should be nice and descriptive ("You skewer the goblin!")
  x Even more descriptive! ("The troll smashes you like an overripe mango!!")
~ Put some messages on same line as previous.
x Unify messages when using ring abilities
x Append "*Stab*" to attack messages as appropriate

Fixes
=====
x Add walls to edges of map after mapgen
x Place stairs only in rooms
x Fix sound propagation
- Reject maps without enough open space
~ Give player credit for deaths caused by malfunctioning machines
- Give player credit for deaths caused by fires
x Show appropriate number of exclamation points on messages about spell damage
x Don't allow confused monsters to attack diagonally.
- Fix bugged liquids with regards to thrown trajectories (fix w/ liquid rework)

Ideas
=====
[+] planned, [~] obsolete, [x] done
~ Layers, as in Brogue? (gas, liquid, surface, floor, etc.)
x Cloaks of invisibility, confusion, blinding, camouflage, electricity
  resistance, fire resistance, etc.
  - cloak of shimmering: chance of daze mob that spots player?
~ Ring of seeing (magic mapping)
~ Rings have negative effects (decreased piety/willpower)
  - obsolete: rings are expected to be worn at all times, not an item that can
    be swapped off or on depending on situation
~ Add bonus (or neg bonus) to attacker if defender moved or didn't move in the
  past two turns
  - obsolete: this game isn't cogmind. besides, too many obscure combat bonuses
    is bad.
~ Ring of intimidation that magic maps dungeon based on mob's memory
  - obsolete: mobs don't have memory. also, how would the UI tell what was mapped
    from another mob's memory vs what the player visited (maybe take a cue from
    cogmind and show such portions in greenscale/grayscale/bluescale?)
~ Crafting grid/alchemy by arranging items on map and dancing
  - obsolete: too complex
x Lighting system and torches
~ Light colors
  - obsolete: would complicate ui too much. "Is that floor color change from a
    light color, gas, or something else?"
x Ring of echolocation to magic-map neighbors of sound-producing tiles
- "Night", when guards sleep, torches go out, and night creatures awaken
- "Ghost database" that stores bones for players who died during game, then
  shows ingame bones/corpses/undead on other games
x Candles that destory people/objects/rooms when quenched
- "Permeability" instead of walkability, that lets creatures pass if they are
  small enough (e.g., rats and small spiders could pass through iron bars)
~ Tile "integrity" that reduces when tile is hit with explosion
  - obsolete: too complex
~ Radioactivity system: nuclear reactors, uranium, corium, nuclear bombs that
  the player can blow up for fun
  - obsolete: too complex, and wouldn't fit lore well
~ Orchestra/Concert, that sings/players instruments and distracts guards
  - obsolete: making all the guards move to one corner of the map suddenly is
    obviously going to make things easier for player /s
~ Night creatures should pop out of artwork at night
- Stone guardians that patrol map and cast confusion at enemies, but move at 1
  tile per 10-20 turns
~ Headstones with previous player's comments on them, or ghosts that mourn
  previous player's carelessnes (think DCSS ghosts)
  ~ Bonus: the ghosts/gravestones are found in the temple in prison cells
~ Pub for guards to get drunk
  - obsolete: how would this affect gameplay? (maybe just a vault would be fine?)
x Ring/item to detect powered machines
- Ring/feature to detect what kind of mob made a noise
- Radioactive gas leaking from a warehouse on a few levels, so a kind of food
  clock
~ Ability to rifle sleeping/drunk/stunned guards as well as corpses
x Undead have other interesting kinds of negative effects when they score a
  hit?
  - Reduced max HP, less regen rate, reduced stealth
  - Done: corruption mechanic
~ Areas that speed up or slow down mobs
- Lichen/fungi that puts mobs to sleep (enchanted ground)
- Ice/oily floor that randomizes movement
- Sticky ground that reduces evasion
x Mobile traps that can be placed by player and used to lure guards on top
  x {Bombs/landmines, bear trap, damage trap} "kits"
x Item/lever player can trigger to unlock locked doors in room, releasing
  prisoners and creating maximum chaos.
~ Use Dijkstra for lighting/FOV?
~ Potion and Ring ID system.
  - obsolete: too complex
x Blood spattering?
x Speech bubbles in following situations: (removed)
- Smell mechanics that allow, say, hellhounds and snakes to detect intruders
  even if they can't see them.
x Ranged melee weapons, e.g., spear and whips
x Add braziers that are built into the walls (aka torches), and use that
  instead for corridors
x Some kind of squad-forming fast-moving swarming mob, like killer bees (DCSS)
  or swarmers (Cogmind 7DRL)
  - done: bone rats
- "cameras kits" that create surface items that keep the surrounding area in the
  FOV of all mobs that have a certain ring on
~ Experiment with "bouncing" rays in raycasting routines
~ Ring/item that has leaving a vunerable "copy" of yourself where that item/ring
  was activated (that is, *two* tiles have the .mob field pointing to the player,
  while the player.coord field points to only one of them).
  - obsolete: could lead to subtle bugs
- weapon runes:
  x interleaving: Swap on hit
  - banishing:    Teleports away
x MP-like system that limits how often spellcasters can cast spells (providing
  a way to tweak dangerous-ness) and how often player can use ring effects.
x Extremely dangerous (but lucrative) vaults that have golden walls, warning
  player of danger.
- Nice floor tile patterns, like Ultima Ratio Regum.

- Bribing: bribe lone monsters to stay quiet, but they'll turn hostile again if
  an unbribed comrade shows up
  - Gold + jewelry collection
  - Bri(b)ing key to bribe lone monsters
- "Doormat" poster that has welcoming messages on it, right next to stairs
  - Maybe describes level's challenges for new players?
x Put actual loot in chests + plus new TGGW-like interace for containers
- Monster: has strong ranged attack with copper weapon, and tries to lure you
  into copper ground
- Monster: spell that grants .Explosive status to nearby ally (while keeping
  distance)

  take some damage. Eventually, player is completely surrounded.
- Monster: shoots blinding gas at player from a distance
- Sometimes monsters leave useless limbs behind instead of a corpse
- Spell/item: makes nearby enemies forget about you faster
  - Downside: if it fails, makes them remember you longer.
  - Inspired by Cogmind's ECM suite
- Spell/item: flingable lava orb! (ie: fiery orb-of-destruction, normally used
  by lava flans)
- Spell/pattern/item: Give +X% block bonus on every Xth turn. (inspiration: StS
  captain's wheel relic)
- Spell/pattern/item: Give +X% hit bonus on every Xth turn. (inspiration: StS
  captain's wheel relic)
- Spell/pattern/item: Deal 3 damage to all visible enemies (or only undead?)
  after X turns (or every X turn?) (inspiration: StS stone calender relic)
- Canceled evocables/machines that need reworking:
  - summon stone: Summons a random (1-3) number of guards on the level to come
    to the command stone's location. 1 charge.
  - transporter stone: "Signals" a nearby spire to come nearby. Reprograms spire
    additionally.
  - "cannons" (LAB): fires projectile in direction, eviscerating any mobs.
    Loud sound. 6 charges, pwr-station powered.
  - "floodgates" (PRI): creates permanent pool of shallow water.
    1 charge, pwr-station powered.
  - "canister of sludge" (CAV): can be "broken open" to release torrent of toxic
    sludge in direction, creating pool and damaging mobs. Takes 2 turns to empty.
    1 charge.
  - "canister of fuel" (VLT): can be "broken open" to release torrent of burning
    fuel in direction, incinerating mobs and creating pool/cloud of fire. Takes 4
    turns to completely empty. 1 charge.
  - "blinding torch": Basically a laser. Can be evoked on a monster that can
    currently see the player (or *could* see the player, if its LOS was long
    enough), and will blind and daze that monster. 4 charges.
  - room reader (TODO: name) (LAB): Can be evoked on an opaque tile that's
    adjacent to the player, such as a door, and it will show player what's
    behind it as if player was standing there. 6 charges.
    - Inspired by that article demonstrating ability to roughly determine
      what's in a room by shining a laser through a keyhole and analysing how
      the light beams bounced around inside.
  - camera reader (TODO: name)
    - Can "hack" pre-placed cameras to spy on nearby areas for X turns?
  - "cannon kit" (CAV): creates permanent cannon on use (see below). 1 charge.
  - "lightning rod" (LAB): severely damages all mobs without rElec in FOV.
    - Note: implement electricity damage propagation for this.
- Headaches
  - Prevent usage of all (or nearly all) evocables/rings (inability to focus).
  - Cure: potion of ibuprofenication (10% chance of "heartburn" aka 1-2 dmg)
  - Possible source: monster that shoots beams of migraine-inducing energy
  - Possible source: aura of microwave radiation (havana sickness? hah)


Optimizations
=============
- Use @mulAdd where possible (FOV, A*, Dijkstra, light/atmosphere/sound systems)
- Use @setCold(true) where possible (see above for places to look)
- Use SIMD where possible
x Use a matrix to mark nodes as closed (instead of a heap-allocated list) for
  Dijkstra.
x Use Manhattan distance for A* algorithm (overestimating heuristic might be better?)
- Allow functions that repeatedly call A* for the same mob to store an "AstarContext"
  structure that allows astar.path() to reuse cell cost, walkablility, etc data
  without calling those functions again.
- Use atan to calculate octant in which coord appears relative to mob's coord, instead
  of the slower method seen in Coord.closestDirectionTo()
- Make Coord a packed struct...?
- TinyAllocator: FixedBufferAllocator, but can deallocate.
  - Probably similar architecture to Finwe's std allocator.


Code cleanups
=============
x Defined unimplemented(), todo(), and oom()
x Stop using the `catch unreachable` syntax:
    libera#zig 19:58 <ikskuh> "catch unreachable" will happily continue to execute code
                              after the error in non-safe build modes
- Remove all floats from color functions, sound systems, gas systems, etc.
x Review usage of usize and change to u64/u32 where needed to prevent portability issues
- Define custom assert() that can give additional context
- Define Lua API and move the following to Lua data files:
  - levelFeature definitions (see mapgen.zig)
  - levelConfig (see mapgen.zig)
- Cleanup/factorize container/item manipulation code for Machine AI.
- Define an on_unpower machine callback, and cleanup sigil_exclusion machine


Refactorings
============
x Define Species struct and carry immutable data for each mob in it
x Convert enum+union pair to union(enum) (see std/fifo.zig) where needed
x Research Manhattan distance vs Euclidian distance vs Moore neighborhood:
  https://reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/nev1jg/a_pathfinding_unstablenondeterministic/
x Add power component to machines
x Use Chebyshev instead of Manhattan distance
- Use arrays and indexes for state.* instead of linked lists and pointers
- Use linked list for roomslist, and use raw pointers instead of indexes
  whenever needed in mapgen code.
x Keep track of each connected room in mapgen, so that no room connects to the
  same room twice.


Tests
=====
x Ensure that distance() treats diagonal moves as more expensive than cardinal moves, or
  the opposite if Chebyshev is used later.
- Full tests for all Coord.* methods
- Full tests for all Rect.* methods
- Full tests for all Direction.* methods
