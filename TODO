               .m.@ → .m@.
               ....   ....
  i.e.: step into a square next to enemy.
  automatic attack that doesn't miss and deals 2x damage. Noisy.

x charge:            ........   ........   ........   ........
          <wait>  →  m......@ → .m....@. → ..m..@.. → ...m@...
                     ........   ........   ........   ........
  i.e.: wait, move three spaces in the same direction towards enemy, ending
  adjacent to enemy.
  automatic attack that doesn't miss, and knocks opponent back three spaces,
  dealing extra damage if they slam into a wall or another mob. Noisy.

x pin:         ...            ...              ....
               .m. → attack → .m@ → attack m → .m.@
               .@.            ...              ....
  gives foe .Held status for 5 turns, just enough to set up a charge.

x cntrattack:  retreat, attack, retreat, attack, retreat.
  Gives you the .Fast status for 4 turns.

- drive-by:    ...   ...              ..@
               .m. → .m@ → attack m → .m.
               ..@   ...              ...
  free attack that doesn't miss, evade += 10% for two turns

- partng shot: .m..                               .m..
               .m@. → attack from top to bottom → .m.@
               .m..                               .m..
  i.e.: attack three foes consectively, where the first and third are both
  adjacent to the second, then step away.
  gives a 20% speed boost for five turns, and increases evade by +10%.

- rampage:     .m.m.   .m.m.
               ..... → ..@.. → attack NW → attack NE
               ..@..   .....
  i.e.: move adjacent to two enemies, attack both consecutively.



Rings
-----
Rings have "tiers" instead of an enchantment level (gold, silver, iron).

x ring of concentration: [holy] Increase willpower by a factor of 2, at the
  cost of melee%, evade%, and slowness.

- ring of provocation: (Alvoc) Tear apart a nearby (standing on/adjacent)
  corpse in a crazed animal rage, causing all visible enemies to either flee or
  become enraged (50/50 chance). Target corpse must be "named".

- ring of ____________: (Alvoc) +50 attack speed, -50 move speed

- ring of anticipation: +10% innate melee boost, will-checked chance to grant
  adjacent enemies `anticipated movements` status, giving them -15% evasion
  - Problem: kinda boring, lots of these kinds of bufs already

- ring of distortion: (alt) Bends space around player, granting +20% evade and
  -20% melee.

- ring of obscuration: Grants "invisible" status, drains 1 MP for each enemy
  that can see player in exchange for them not noticing player. No MP drain
  when player can't be seen. 0 MP to start with. (Needs downside. Maybe doesn't
  work if player is directly adjacent, or player is corrupted and target is
  undead?)
  - Maybe MP drain only occurs if player fails will-check? (Maybe ring could
    have Will-3)

- ring of ____________: Grants enemy on conductive terrain "gathering charge"
  status, causing them to take damage each turn they stand on that terrain
  (status is cured when they walk off)

- ring of demolition: Explosion centered on player, player takes no damage.
  (Needs some downside/quirk to make it interesting. Only works if completely
  surrounded (by either allies or enemies? hmm, could be useful for summoners)?
  Damage is low, but gives player bad/good effect for each enemy injured?)

- ring of ____________: Gives "sanctuary" + disorient status effects. Sanctuary
  status damages and .Held's(10) any mob adjacent (cardinals only), and doesn't
  affect mobs with .Held. Creates puzzle-like gameplay. Damage could scale with
  some stat.

x ring of condemnation: [holy] instakill undead, at cost of 10 turns held.
  Ancient Mage should have some kind of countermeasure (transform into
  something else? explode into swarm of enemies?)

- ring of infestation: Gives infestation status (mob-only), "night beatles"
  burst out of affected mob when status effect ends. Night beatles should only
  be dangerous in larger numbers (maybe steal ghoul respawn mechanic from SPD?)
  - Potion of infestation + infestation gas: infestation status to
    paralyzed/will==0/in-dark-area mobs (still haven't decided, maybe a
    combination of the two

x ring of transformation: turns all fire into electricity. "Heals" the burning
  status, and targets self.

x ring of detonation: make enemy explosive+noisy+insane+immobile

x ring of deception: [anti-Holy] undead mistake you for ally unless non-undead
  allies are nearby

- ring of fustigation: [holy] undead explode, causing other undead to explode,
  chain reaction
  - Explosion only over cardinals... unless disoriented, then it's only
    diagonals
  - will/2-will damage, damage stacks
  - cannot be used while corrupt and target must be undead, doesn't affect
    non-undead

  player. Blinks player as well. All affected mobs, including player, have

  pattern to fight, giving it impressive tankiness and stat boosts (but
  slowness?).

  knockback.

- ring of fear: confer fear on a single enemy.

x ring of magnetization: cause knockback of all nearby foes onto a single foe.

  player must plan accordingly.
  - Attack foe and move behind it.

    @m..  attack(m)  .m..  .m@.  attack(m)
    ....             ....  ....

  14-28 turns. Zombies are completely blind and won't fight any other monster
  unless attacked.

    .....        .@...  .....  .....  .....
    @M...  wait  .M...  @M...  .M...  @M...

x ring of electrification: Electrocute all mobs on one side.
  - Attack mob, move one tile backwards into corridor (ie with walls on the
    other two sides of your character), wait, attack forwards

    ..@M...  attack(M)  .@M....   wait   attack(M)
    ##.m...             ##m....
    ##.....             ##.....

x ring of teleportation: Zap an enemy, then teleport to where the zap ended
  (i.e. Blinkbolt spell).
  - Attack, move away, move in adjacent cardinal direction, move again in same
    direction, attack any enemy.
    .....           .....   .....   .....
    m@...           .m@..   ..m..   .....
    ..... attack(m) .....   ...@.   ...m. attack(any)
    .....           .....   .....   ...@.

x ring of damnation: create a fire explosion on all tiles containing foes.
  - Move towards a wall, wait, attack in the opposite direction.

    ...##   ...##

x ring of electrocution: Electrocute tiles in four corners next to player.
  - Attack in a cardinal direction, move in opposite direction, move
    perpendicular, attack again

    ....        @...   .@..
  x Iron:   2 damage.

  - Gold:   4 damage.

x ring of cremation: Makes all adjacent foes temporarily vulnerable to fire,
  and creates ring of flames in all adjacent squares.
  - Move all around mob in four turns (w/o attacking or resting).
    .....          .....   .....   ..@..
    ..m@.  attack  ..m..   .@m..   ..m..
    .....          ..@..   .....   .....
  - Silver: create ring of flames in 2-tile radius.
  - Gold:   create ring of flames in 3-tile radius.

x ring of extermination: fire bolt of fire in direction.
  - Move forward against guard, move right/left, move forward
    ....   ....   ....   ....
    @.m.   .@m.   ..m.   ..m.
    ....   ....   .@..   ..@.

- ring of ignition: Summon orbs of lava (a la DCSS' Foxfire).
  - Move in zig-zag direction away from mob.
    .....   .....   ......   ......   ......
    m@...   m....   m..@..   m.....   m....@
    .....   ..@..   ......   ....@.   ......

~ ring of debilitation: -10-30% melee, -10-30% missile
  - Obsolete: covered by potions of debilitation, seizure traps

~ ring of intimidation: confer stun/fear to mob when moving towards it, while
  enraging all other monsters in FOV.
  - Cancelled: overlaps with !intimidation and effect isn't good enough.

~ ring of propulsion: knockback two foes next to you 5-9 spaces.
  - Attack two enemies in opposite directions, move in cardinal direction,
    move back, wait.
  - Canceled: effect is too similar to charging
    .....                           .....   .....
    .....                           .....   .....
    .1@2.   attack(1)   attack(2)   .1.2.   .1@2.   wait
    .....                           ..@..   .....
    .....                           .....   .....

- ring of encumberation (gold only): melee,missile=100%, evade=0%

Other ideas:
  - Passively allows player to know if they're still being pursued.
  - Allows player to see spots near pursuers (but not the pursuers
    themselves?) for ~3-5 turns.
    - Movement pattern:
  - Can destroy a wall tile, sending shards of lethally sharp stone
    hurtling towards adjacent mobs. Harder stones == more damage.
    .Deafening noise.
  - Vampirism idea: vampiric ring of draining
    - Drains an enemy for {speed,health,HP}.
    - Allows player to see that mob and all tiles within two spaces.
    - Player will get a status (paralyzed? slowed? negative regen? traumatize? stun?)
      for a bit when the enemy dies OR the enemy sees the player.
    - The drained mob immedietely becomes an enemy to everyone.
    - If the enemy dies, the player is teleported there in its place?
    - Movement pattern: ???
  - Causes dark gas to emanate from player. Gas is opaque and blocks all light.
  - Causes all nearby machines to lose power for a bit (aka turn out the lights).
  - Dismissal: forces all investigating mobs in LOS to return to working.
    If resisted by willpower, will reveal player's location to them.

maps
  - maps of just mob stations
  - maps of just presence of walls/floors
  - maps of special item locations (rings/potions)
  - maps of machine locations (recharging stations/drains)
  - maps of possible stair locations
manuals
  - extremely rare, found in golden rooms
  - provides boost to a stat the player may or may not be able to take
    advantage of, depending on build type.
  - stats: missile%, evade%, martial combo, sneak, missile%
  - idea: ability to attack more quickly (decreased weapon delay)
  - idea: mp * 1.5, mp * 2, mp * 2.5
  - idea: permanent riposte effect
  - idea: open melee effect (book teaches you melee methods that only work in the open)
  - idea: closed melee effect (book teaches how to fight effectively in corridors)
  - idea: book of torment -> 25% bloodlust

  whatever it was moved along)
  x UNLESS incident_count > 10, then it continues rising indefinitely

Items/Machines
==============
x Add cloaks:
  x cloak of silicon (fire resistance)
  x cloak of fur     (electricty resistance)
  ~ cloak of velvet
    - 30% chance for hostile to not notice mob, even when mob is in hostile's FOV

    for 2 turns. 4 charges.
  x "symbol of torment"
  ~ "fume hood" (CAV): Grants rFume∞ for ~10 turns. 4 charges.
  ~ "hammer": Destroys a machine. ∞ charges; cannot be recharged.
  x "iron spike": Jams a door. 1 charge; cannot be recharged.

  x recharging stations: 4 charges. 1-2 per level.
    ~ 'r' key is shortcut to evoke recharging station, when such a station is

  x Even more descriptive! ("The troll smashes you like an overripe mango!!")
~ Put some messages on same line as previous.
x Unify messages when using ring abilities
- Append "*Stab*" to attack messages as appropriate

Fixes

- Give player credit for deaths caused by fires
x Show appropriate number of exclamation points on messages about spell damage
x Don't allow confused monsters to attack diagonally.
- Fix bugged liquids with regards to thrown trajectories (fix w/ liquid rework)

Ideas
=====
[+] planned, [~] obsolete, [x] done
~ Layers, as in Brogue? (gas, liquid, surface, floor, etc.)
+ Cloaks of invisibility, confusion, blinding, camouflage, electricity
  resistance, fire resistance, etc.
  - cloak of shimmering: chance of daze mob that spots player?
- Ring of seeing (magic mapping)
~ Rings have negative effects (decreased piety/willpower)
  - obsolete: rings are expected to be worn at all times, not an item that can
    be swapped off or on depending on situation
~ Add bonus (or neg bonus) to attacker if defender moved or didn't move in the
  past two turns
  - obsolete: this game isn't cogmind. besides, too many obscure combat bonuses
    is bad.
~ Ring of intimidation that magic maps dungeon based on mob's memory
  - obsolete: mobs don't have memory. also, how would the UI tell what was mapped
    from another mob's memory vs what the player visited (maybe take a cue from
    cogmind and show such portions in greenscale/grayscale/bluescale?)
~ Crafting grid/alchemy by arranging items on map and dancing
  - obsolete: too complex
x Lighting system and torches
~ Light colors
  - obsolete: would complicate ui too much. "Is that floor color change from a
    light color, gas, or something else?"
x Ring of echolocation to magic-map neighbors of sound-producing tiles
- "Night", when guards sleep, torches go out, and night creatures awaken
- "Ghost database" that stores bones for players who died during game, then
  shows ingame bones/corpses/undead on other games
- Candles that destory people/objects/rooms when quenched
- "Permeability" instead of walkability, that lets creatures pass if they are
  small enough (e.g., rats and small spiders could pass through iron bars)
~ Tile "integrity" that reduces when tile is hit with explosion
  - obsolete: too complex
~ Radioactivity system: nuclear reactors, uranium, corium, nuclear bombs that
  the player can blow up for fun
  - obsolete: too complex, and wouldn't fit lore well
~ Orchestra/Concert, that sings/players instruments and distracts guards
  - obsolete: making all the guards move to one corner of the map suddenly is
    obviously going to make things easier for player /s
- Goblin "organizations" (purely eye candy)
  - the Goblin Brotherhood, the ProudGobbos, the Seven Percenters, the
    Goblin Nations, etc
- Night creatures should pop out of artwork at night
- Stone guardians that patrol map and cast confusion at enemies, but move at 1
  tile per 10-20 turns
  //- obsolete: that's abominations now
- Headstones with previous player's comments on them, or ghosts that mourn
  previous player's carelessnes (think DCSS ghosts)
  - Bonus: the ghosts/gravestones are found in the temple in prison cells
~ Pub for guards to get drunk
  - obsolete: how would this affect gameplay? (maybe just a vault would be fine?)
- Ring to detect powered machines
- Ring/feature to detect what kind of mob made a noise
- Radioactive gas leaking from a warehouse on a few levels, so a kind of food
  clock
~ Ability to rifle sleeping/drunk/stunned guards as well as corpses
x Undead have other interesting kinds of negative effects when they score a
  hit?
  - Reduced max HP, less regen rate, reduced stealth
  - Done: corruption mechanic
~ Areas that speed up or slow down mobs
- Lichen/fungi that puts mobs to sleep (enchanted ground)
- Ice/oily floor that randomizes movement
- Sticky ground that reduces evasion
x Mobile traps that can be placed by player and used to lure guards on top
  x {Bombs/landmines, bear trap, damage trap} "kits"
x Item/lever player can trigger to unlock locked doors in room, releasing
  prisoners and creating maximum chaos.
~ Use Dijkstra for lighting/FOV?
~ Potion and Ring ID system.
  - obsolete: too complex
x Blood spattering?
x Speech bubbles in following situations: (removed)
- Smell mechanics that allow, say, hellhounds and snakes to detect intruders
  even if they can't see them.
x Ranged melee weapons, e.g., spear and whips
x Add braziers that are built into the walls (aka torches), and use that
  instead for corridors
x Some kind of squad-forming fast-moving swarming mob, like killer bees (DCSS)
  or swarmers (Cogmind 7DRL)
  - done: bone rats
- "cameras kits" that create surface items that keep the surrounding area in the
  FOV of all mobs that have a certain ring on
~ Experiment with "bouncing" rays in raycasting routines
~ Ring/item that has leaving a vunerable "copy" of yourself where that item/ring
  was activated (that is, *two* tiles have the .mob field pointing to the player,
  while the player.coord field points to only one of them).
  - obsolete: could lead to subtle bugs
- weapon runes:
  - interleaving: Swap on hit
  - banishing:    Teleports away
x MP-like system that limits how often spellcasters can cast spells (providing
  a way to tweak dangerous-ness) and how often player can use ring effects.
x Extremely dangerous (but lucrative) vaults that have golden walls, warning
  player of danger.
- Nice floor tile patterns, like Ultima Ratio Regum.

- Bribing: bribe lone monsters to stay quiet, but they'll turn hostile again if
  an unbribed comrade shows up
  - Gold + jewelry collection
  - Bri(b)ing key to bribe lone monsters

  take some damage. Eventually, player is completely surrounded.
- Monster: shoots blinding gas at player from a distance
- Sometimes monsters leave useless limbs behind instead of a corpse
- Spell/item: makes nearby enemies forget about you faster
  - Downside: if it fails, makes them remember you longer.
  - Inspired by Cogmind's ECM suite
- Spell/item: flingable lava orb! (ie: fiery orb-of-destruction, normally used
  by lava flans)
- Spell/pattern/item: Give +X% block bonus on every Xth turn. (inspiration: StS
  captain's wheel relic)
- Spell/pattern/item: Give +X% hit bonus on every Xth turn. (inspiration: StS
  captain's wheel relic)
- Spell/pattern/item: Deal 3 damage to all visible enemies (or only undead?)
  after X turns (or every X turn?) (inspiration: StS stone calender relic)
- Canceled evocables/machines that need reworking:
  - summon stone: Summons a random (1-3) number of guards on the level to come
    to the command stone's location. 1 charge.
  - transporter stone: "Signals" a nearby spire to come nearby. Reprograms spire
    additionally.
  - "cannons" (LAB): fires projectile in direction, eviscerating any mobs.
    Loud sound. 6 charges, pwr-station powered.
  - "floodgates" (PRI): creates permanent pool of shallow water.
    1 charge, pwr-station powered.
  - "canister of sludge" (CAV): can be "broken open" to release torrent of toxic
    sludge in direction, creating pool and damaging mobs. Takes 2 turns to empty.
    1 charge.
  - "canister of fuel" (VLT): can be "broken open" to release torrent of burning
    fuel in direction, incinerating mobs and creating pool/cloud of fire. Takes 4
    turns to completely empty. 1 charge.
  - "blinding torch": Basically a laser. Can be evoked on a monster that can
    currently see the player (or *could* see the player, if its LOS was long
    enough), and will blind and daze that monster. 4 charges.
  - room reader (TODO: name) (LAB): Can be evoked on an opaque tile that's
    adjacent to the player, such as a door, and it will show player what's
    behind it as if player was standing there. 6 charges.
    - Inspired by that article demonstrating ability to roughly determine
      what's in a room by shining a laser through a keyhole and analysing how
      the light beams bounced around inside.
  - camera reader (TODO: name)
    - Can "hack" pre-placed cameras to spy on nearby areas for X turns?
  - "cannon kit" (CAV): creates permanent cannon on use (see below). 1 charge.
  - "lightning rod" (LAB): severely damages all mobs without rElec in FOV.
    - Note: implement electricity damage propagation for this.

Optimizations
=============
- Use @mulAdd where possible (FOV, A*, Dijkstra, light/atmosphere/sound systems)
- Use @setCold(true) where possible (see above for places to look)
- Use SIMD where possible
x Use a matrix to mark nodes as closed (instead of a heap-allocated list) for
  Dijkstra.
x Use Manhattan distance for A* algorithm (overestimating heuristic might be better?)
- Allow functions that repeatedly call A* for the same mob to store an "AstarContext"
  structure that allows astar.path() to reuse cell cost, walkablility, etc data
  without calling those functions again.
- Use atan to calculate octant in which coord appears relative to mob's coord, instead
  of the slower method seen in Coord.closestDirectionTo()

Code cleanups
=============
x Defined unimplemented(), todo(), and oom()
x Stop using the `catch unreachable` syntax:
    libera#zig 19:58 <ikskuh> "catch unreachable" will happily continue to execute code
                              after the error in non-safe build modes
- Remove all floats from color functions, sound systems, gas systems, etc.
x Review usage of usize and change to u64/u32 where needed to prevent portability issues
- Define custom assert() that can give additional context
- Define Lua API and move the following to Lua data files:
  - levelFeature definitions (see mapgen.zig)
  - levelConfig (see mapgen.zig)
- Cleanup/factorize container/item manipulation code for Machine AI.

Refactorings
============
x Define Species struct and carry immutable data for each mob in it
x Convert enum+union pair to union(enum) (see std/fifo.zig) where needed
x Research Manhattan distance vs Euclidian distance vs Moore neighborhood:
  https://reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/nev1jg/a_pathfinding_unstablenondeterministic/
x Add power component to machines
x Use Chebyshev instead of Manhattan distance
- Use arrays and indexes for state.* instead of linked lists and pointers
- Use linked list for roomslist, and use raw pointers instead of indexes
  whenever needed in mapgen code.
x Keep track of each connected room in mapgen, so that no room connects to the
  same room twice.

Tests
=====
x Ensure that distance() treats diagonal moves as more expensive than cardinal moves, or
  the opposite if Chebyshev is used later.
- Full tests for all Coord.* methods
- Full tests for all Rect.* methods
- Full tests for all Direction.* methods
