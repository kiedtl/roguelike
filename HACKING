This codebase is a sprawling mess of garbage created over a period of five
years where I simultaneously taught myself Zig, roguelike development, SDL2, 2D
UI design and a bunch of other concepts from first principles whilst stubbornly
refusing to look at a single tutorial or guide. If you choose to fork this
codebase and work on it, you will have my permission but not my blessing.
