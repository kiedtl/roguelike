These prototype eldritch paralysation systems are a copper mine of potential,
able to paralyse the accursed Earth Demons at a far greater range and speed than
the ones currently in use. I don't understand, however, why the Hugghehel
didn't immediately put them into operation given their obvious superiority.

I find their chosen colors interesting. Grey for the earliest models, yellow
for the current ones, and green for the prototypes. -- MAG. NATH
