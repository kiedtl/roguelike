-- BURNING BRUTE CONTAINMENT AREA --

That the Hugghehel managed to capture the two Burning Brutes that were found
wandering in this area is extraordinary, doubly so as their records state that
they seem to be much more resiliant to the effects of the eldritch transmitters
than the Revgenuhelkim, and were not dazed or confused at the time of their
capture.
