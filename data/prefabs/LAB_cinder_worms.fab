-- CINDER BRUTE HOLDING CELL --

This strange creature is undoubtedly one of the Revgenuhelkim, though strangely
it was not encountered at all at Iredelemnul; at least, no record of them
persists. The Hugghehel found two wandering in the vicinity of Traumbulnahl in
a dazed state, and were able to capture them both without incident. Preliminary
research was done by the Hugghehel on these creatures, with the following
conclusions:


- It is suggested that it also is vulnerable to eldritch transmitters, but this
  cannot be verified as both have entered a dormant state and are now
  completely unresponsive.

- It is likely that they are vulnerable to electricity.

- Examination suggests that its hide is much stronger than the skin of
  ordinary Revgenuhelkim, strong enough to possibly deflect our best steel
  projectiles, but this cannot be confirmed without harming and potentially
  waking the creatures.
